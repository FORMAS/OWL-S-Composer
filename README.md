# OWL-S Composer

## About

OWL-S Composer is a plug-in for the Eclipse IDE developed by [FORMAS](http://wiki.dcc.ufba.br/FORMAS/WebHome) (Research Group on Semantic Applications and Formalisms) at UFBA (Federal University of Bahia). The plug-in offers a set of features to handle semantic web services such as:

* Compare compositions by semantic similarity;
* Compose services through the use of visual diagrams;
* Discover services by similarity;
* Run compositions;
* Track running services.

This tool is being mainly developed by Computer's Science undergraduate students as part of their final report.
